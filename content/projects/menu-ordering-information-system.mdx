## Why I create this project?

CafÃ© Studio Rosid is a place of business that serves food and beverage menus that are sold in general to the public and provides a unique place for visitors. So far, the menu ordering process is done manually, by using an order note. This process can cause several problems, such as: unsatisfactory service to visitors, errors in presentation, and errors in the payment process.

This study aims to develop a Web-Based Menu Ordering Information System at CafÃ© Studio Rosid. An information system that can order an integrated menu that will make menu ordering efficient and effective, menu data management, employee data management and displaying an organized and computerized order list at the stage of developing this information system using the waterfall method and built using MERN STACK technology and Socket.IO

## Project Goals

1. Building an information system to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of menu ordering.
2. Addressing the challenge of swiftly and accurately monitoring the cafe's financial performance.
3. Creating an environment where customers only need to sit comfortably at their tables.
4. Overcoming the communication issues between waiters and the kitchen that are not efficient.
5. Developing an information system that can present sales data to support future sales decisions.

## Tech Stack Used

In this project, I developed using the Full Stack JavaScript technology, namely MERN, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. MongoDB serves as the database, Express and Node.js function as the backend components, and React is utilized for the frontend. Additionally, for two-way real-time communication in this project, i use Socket.IO. I design User interface with Figma.
