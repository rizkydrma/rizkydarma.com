## Introduction

The company profile website for one of the furniture companies in Bandung is my first project that has yielded earnings. In this project, I designed the website using Figma and presented it to the client after receiving their approval. We agreed to transform the approved design into the actual website. I am hoping to secure more projects, so for those of you in need of my services, feel free to contact me. XD

## Tech Stack Used

In this project, I utilized Figma for the UI design, and for the website itself, I used React JS while implementing pure CSS for styling purposes.
